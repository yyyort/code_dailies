'''
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
Find The Unique

def find_uniq(arr):
    # your code here

    for i in range(2, len(arr)):
        if arr[0] == arr[1]:
            if arr[1] != arr[i]:
                return arr[i]
        else:
            n1,n2 = arr[0], arr[1]
            
            if n1 == arr[i]:
                return n2
            else:
                return n1
